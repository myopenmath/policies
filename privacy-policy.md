<h2 id="information-collected">1. Information Collected</h2>

a. *Personal Data*.
If you create an account on the MyOpenMath Services, or communicate with MyOpenMath, you will provide to MyOpenMath certain information by which someone could personally identify you, such as your name, email or unique username (“**Personally Identifiable Information**”), as well as information about yourself such as your employment by which someone could not personally identify you (“**Demographic Information**”). When we link Demographic Information to your Personally Identifiable Information, we treat all of it as Personally Identifiable.
We also collect information when you save or post content to the Service (“**User Content**”) and communicate with us.
We refer to all of this data collectively as “**Personal Data**”.
We may also collect Personal Data about you from a third party Internet site or service.
For example, if you login to your MyOpenMath account through an Learning Tools Interoperability ("**LTI**") connection from a School's Learning Management System, we may collect the Personal Data that third party service shares.

b. *Usage Data*.
We automatically collect certain technical usage information (“**Usage Data**”) when you use the MyOpenMath Services.
Usage Data includes the information that your web browser automatically sends to our servers whenever you visit.
The Usage Data collected in our logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, click history, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and whether you opened an email.

Typically, Usage Data is collected through log files, web beacons, browser cookies, or other device identifiers that may uniquely identify your browser or device.
You may be able to set your web browser to refuse all cookies.
You may not be able to delete or disable cookies on certain browsers.
For more information on cookies, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](//www.allaboutcookies.org).
Remember, the MyOpenMath Services may not function properly if cookies are not enabled.

In addition, the MyOpenMath Services may use third party analytics and bug tracking software (including, without limitation, NewRelic) to collect further Usage Data regarding the online usage patterns of our users and bugs in our Services. We may combine Usage Data with Personal Data in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.

Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time. We do not permit third party advertising networks or other third parties to collect information about your browsing behavior from our website for advertising purposes.

<h2 id="use-of-information">2. Use of Your Information</h2>

a. *Use*.
We use your Personal Data and Usage Data (together, “**User Information**”) to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the MyOpenMath Services and for related business purposes.
We may use your User Information to (a) improve the quality and design of the MyOpenMath Services and to create new features and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences; (b) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the MyOpenMath Services; (c) provide custom, personalized content and information; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) diagnose and fix technology problems and otherwise plan for and enhance our Service.
MyOpenMath may provide personalized content and information to teachers, school administration officials, and other users associated with Schools. However, MyOpenMath will never use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising, nor will MyOpenMath direct advertising to student users, nor will MyOpenMath ever use any third-party advertising network on any MyOpenMath Service.

b. *Communications Preferences*.
We will not use your email address or other Personally Identifiable Information to send you marketing messages unless you provide your consent, or as part of a specific program or feature from which you will have the ability to opt-out.
You can always opt-out of receiving notification emails from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” feature at the bottom of each email or by adjusting your email notification preferences in your settings.
We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes, such as notifying you of important MyOpenMath Services changes or for customer service purposes.

<h2 id="disclosure-of-info">3. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

a. *Publication by You*.
You may share your User Information, including Personally Identifiable Information and other content that you create or post to others accessing the MyOpenMath Services, by using applicable sections of the MyOpenMath Services (including sections for teachers which enable you to create questions, create question libraries, share courses, and post to support forums).
Please see the [Student Data Privacy Statement](/studentdata) to learn how Student Data may be shared.

b. *To Service Providers*.
We share User Information with our trusted third party service providers and other individuals who perform services on our behalf, for example, providing hosting services, analytics, and other services we utilize to help us provide our Service or conduct our business.
These service providers access and use User Information only to provide services to MyOpenMath under reasonable confidentiality terms.

c. *To Schools*.
We may share User Information when we work with a School or educational institution to provide the Service to students.

We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of Schools.

d. *Other Required Sharing*.
We may share User Information: (i) if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is to comply with state and federal laws (including, without limitation, copyright laws) or in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process or search warrant, or (ii) if we believe, in good faith, such action is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, to exercise our legal rights, to take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the MyOpenMath Services, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of MyOpenMath, Schools, our users, or third parties.

e. *School Administrators*.
For Schools utilizing our School Administrator functionality, school administration officials may be able to view User Information for students and teachers at their school, and may be able to modify User Content created by students and teachers at their school.

f. *Sharing of Student Work*.
In some instances, Student Data, including, for example, student's posts in a course forum, (collectively, "Student Work") may be visible to other students in the same classroom. A teacher or school administration official will be able to monitor any such Student Work and will be able to delete it at their discretion, for example if said Student Work is in violation of a school's policies or the teacher's desired classroom culture.

g. *Merger or Sale*.
If we merge, sell, or otherwise transfer all or a portion of our business, we will not transfer your Personally Identifiable Information without first giving you the ability to opt-out of the transfer, unless the new owner intends to maintain and provide the applicable MyOpenMath Services as a going concern, and provided that the new owner has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own.
We may also transfer personal information &ndash; under the same conditions &ndash; in the course of mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of our business.

<h2 id="choices">4. Your Choices</h2>

<h2 id="childrens-privacy">6. Children’s Privacy</h2>

Our Service is not directed to children under 13, unless and until a School has provided consent and authorization for a student under 13 to use the Service and for MyOpenMath to collect information from such student.
If you believe that we have inadvertently collected Personal Data from a child under 13 years of age without parental consent, then please alert us at [support@MyOpenMath.com](support@MyOpenMath.com) and we will promptly delete the child's Personal Data from our systems.
