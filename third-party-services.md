# Third Party Services

We only share your data with trusted partners. We will never sell your data third parties. These partners help us improve our product, for example by providing hosting and analytics.

Here is the list of 3rd party services that we might share your information with, as of December 21, 2019:

- **[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)**: We use AWS for server hosting (EC2), Data Storage (S3), Transactional Email (SES), Database (RDS), and a number of internal services for managing our operations.
- **[New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)**: We use New Relic to track site performance and for detecting server-side and client-side code errors.
